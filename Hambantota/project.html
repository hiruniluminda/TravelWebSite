    Also, crocodiles are more common around lagoons. As you walk through the dry trees, monkeys and parrots will be able to catch a glimpse of peacocks dancing among the yellow and red dry leaves that fall to the ground, displaying their blue and green feathers. From time to time wild elephants and shrubs and bushes appear across the road and re-enter the forest, bringing invisible tigers to the park.
